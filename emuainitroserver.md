The Personalized Computer is a specialized Silicon Graphics Indigo workstation computer that is hypothesized to have been used in certain aspects of Super Mario 64, including the Personalisation AI. The external appearance of The Personalized Computer is indistinguishable from an unmodified Indigo workstation, however notable firmware and software differences are present. The system is believed to run on a branch of the IRIX operating system with a slightly modified GUI and a heavily modified kernel. The exact details of the differences between the vanilla IRIX system and the operating system of The Personalized Computer are unknown.

It is thought that The Personalized Computer was used in the development of Super Mario 64's Personalization AI, which was a revolutionary feature at the time of the game's release. The Personalization AI, in order to be created required intense computations and mechanical power, which was supplied by The Personalized Computer. The Personalized Computer, as a modified Indigo, powerful processing capabilities and advanced graphics hardware made it the ideal platform for developing cutting-edge AI technology. Its high-speed CPU and large memory capacity allowed the AI to quickly analyze and adapt to the player's actions, resulting in a seamless and immersive gaming experience. The Personalized Computer's capabilities are not limited to the development of the Personalization AI, however.  This one is. known as fast256 a ehnachicing api for software
